# ChangeLog

-----
‚ö†Ô∏è Java change AGAIN (June-2021 Update)
-----

Mojang decided to unilaterally move from JAVA 11 > JAVA 16 (yup a jump of 5 versions and the use of a no LTS, ...).     
Since Vanilla 1.17, there is the need to use a new JVM so for now this repo isn't natively compatible with 1.17 (as the 8th of June).

## NOT READY FOR Vanilla 1.17 " YET " !!!!

-----
üìå JAVA Software changes (March-2021 Update)

In order to simplify management and updates this project now relies on : [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net)   
- ```/usr/lib/jvm/adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot-jre-amd64/bin/java``` : for profiles after v1.16
- ```/usr/lib/jvm/adoptopenjdk-8-hotspot-jre-amd64/bin/java``` : for profiles Spigot/PaperSpigot before v1.16.1
- ```/usr/lib/jvm/adoptopenjdk-8-openj9-jre-amd64/bin/java```: for profiles Vanilla before v.1.16.1

=> Clear table of the versions used [HERE](https://github.com/ValentinTh/MultiCraft-JAR-Conf/blob/master/HOW-TO/QUICK-INTRODUCTION.md)

-----
‚ö†Ô∏è Java Versions on servers (December-2020 Update)

Minecraft Vanilla since v1.16.2 no longer supports Java J9 versions, HOTSPOT is used instead.     
PaperSpigot just announced that Java 11 will be mandatory from Minecraft 1.17+ versions.
